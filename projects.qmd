## Completed Projects

1. **Sleep Quality -- A Potential Link in the Relation Between Occupational Stress and Inflammation: A pilot study in female nurses**

**Role**: PI

*Funding*: Indian Council of Medical Research-Intramural funding

In this pilot work, we delved into the intricate dynamics of how occupational stress impacts sleep quality and inflammation among female nurses. Our motivation stemmed from observing the high stress levels within nursing professions and its potential implications on health including reported suicides. We explored this specifically through disrupted sleep and increased inflammation levels, which are precursors to numerous chronic diseases. This work is currently under review in *Scientific Reports- Burnout and Stress Collection*.

Moving forward, we understand the urgent need for interventions focusing on stress management and sleep improvement among nurses. In our future endeavors, we aim to develop and test targeted strategies to mitigate these stress-induced health impacts, potentially transforming workplace wellness programs and policies to better support our healthcare workers' well-being.


2. **Effectiveness of mindfulness in reducing perceived stress among Nurses: A systematic review and meta- analysis.**

**Role**: PI

*Funding*: None

Our investigation into the impacts of occupational stress on sleep quality and inflammation in nurses laid the foundation for an important subsequent step. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, during which I had the privilege of mentoring an MPH dissertation student.

We registered our protocol in PROSPERO ([Access record here](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=509223)), demonstrating our commitment to transparency and rigor. Over the course of the project, we thoroughly examined the existing literature, assessing the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions among nurses. This work was particularly groundbreaking in the Indian context, where mindfulness practices remain less prevalent within healthcare settings.

This study shed light on how mindfulness can help ease the stress nurses face, offering practical ways to create workplaces where they can truly thrive, not just get by. It was a fulfilling effort that adds meaningful insights to support the well-being of the people who are the backbone of healthcare.
