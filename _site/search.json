I was associated with the Centre for Addiction Medicine, NIMHANS which is the Regional Centre for South India. I specialized in Substance Use Disorders with a special focus in Alcohol Use Disorder. I also got trained in Genetics and Epigenetics of Alcohol Use Disorder in the Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the Neurobiology Research Centre, NIMHANS. I aimed at examining epigenetic changes in alcohol and one carbon metabolism genes in the context of nutritional changes and treatment outcome in a prospective cohort study. By adopting a longitudinal approach, I investigated the potential methylation changes in the regions of interest."

As a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) / National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA from 2018-2020, I worked in the capacity of an Assistant Investigator in the protocols of my section at Human Psychopharmacology, NIAAA/NIH under the supervision of Dr. Vijay Ramchandani, Ph.D. At the lab, we conducted research on human subjects administering intravenous alcohol infusions along with post-baccalaureate candidates in my section. I was involved in writing and conducting protocols, grants, authored manuscripts in a collaborative environment. At the NIH, I was trained at multiple domains, including Responsible Conduct of Research, online technology transfer, data quality management, writing research papers, On becoming a responsible researcher, and also on workplace management. I worked on multiple data projects, maintaining data in a safe and secured manner, involved in developing analysis pipelines for quantitative data analyses. I also mentored post-baccalaureate in data analysis, management and visualization techniques and also writing analysis reports, abstracts for conferences and manuscripts. While doing so, I developed much interest in the concept of “Reproducible Research”. I learnt and strengthened my analytical skills specifically in “R” platform to generate reproducible analyses. This motivated me to be an advocate for Open Science and Reproducible Research."
