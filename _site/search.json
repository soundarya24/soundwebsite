    "text": "Sleep Quality – A Potential Link in the Relation Between Occupational Stress and Inflammation: A pilot study in female nurses\n\nRole: PI\nFunding: Indian Council of Medical Research-Intramural funding\nIn this pilot work, we delved into the intricate dynamics of how occupational stress impacts sleep quality and inflammation among female nurses. Our motivation stemmed from observing the high stress levels within nursing professions and its potential implications on health including reported suicides. We explored this specifically through disrupted sleep and increased inflammation levels, which are precursors to numerous chronic diseases. This work is currently under review in Scientific Reports- Burnout and Stress Collection.\nMoving forward, we understand the urgent need for interventions focusing on stress management and sleep improvement among nurses. In our future endeavors, we aim to develop and test targeted strategies to mitigate these stress-induced health impacts, potentially transforming workplace wellness programs and policies to better support our healthcare workers’ well-being.\n\nEffectiveness of mindfulness in reducing perceived stress among Nurses: A systematic review and meta- analysis.\n\nRole: PI\nFunding: None\nOur investigation into the impacts of occupational stress on sleep quality and inflammation in nurses laid the foundation for an important subsequent step. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, during which I had the privilege of mentoring an MPH dissertation student.\nWe registered our protocol in PROSPERO (Access record here), demonstrating our commitment to transparency and rigor. Over the course of the project, we thoroughly examined the existing literature, assessing the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions among nurses. This work was particularly groundbreaking in the Indian context, where mindfulness practices remain less prevalent within healthcare settings.\nThis study shed light on how mindfulness can help ease the stress nurses face, offering practical ways to create workplaces where they can truly thrive, not just get by. It was a fulfilling effort that adds meaningful insights to support the well-being of the people who are the backbone of healthcare."

I was associated with the Centre for Addiction Medicine, NIMHANS which is the Regional Centre for South India. I specialized in Substance Use Disorders with a special focus in Alcohol Use Disorder. I also got trained in Genetics and Epigenetics of Alcohol Use Disorder in the Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the Neurobiology Research Centre, NIMHANS. I aimed at examining epigenetic changes in alcohol and one carbon metabolism genes in the context of nutritional changes and treatment outcome in a prospective cohort study. By adopting a longitudinal approach, I investigated the potential methylation changes in the regions of interest."

As a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) / National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA from 2018-2020, I worked in the capacity of an Assistant Investigator in the protocols of my section at Human Psychopharmacology, NIAAA/NIH under the supervision of Dr. Vijay Ramchandani, Ph.D. At the lab, we conducted research on human subjects administering intravenous alcohol infusions along with post-baccalaureate candidates in my section. I was involved in writing and conducting protocols, grants, authored manuscripts in a collaborative environment. At the NIH, I was trained at multiple domains, including Responsible Conduct of Research, online technology transfer, data quality management, writing research papers, On becoming a responsible researcher, and also on workplace management. I worked on multiple data projects, maintaining data in a safe and secured manner, involved in developing analysis pipelines for quantitative data analyses. I also mentored post-baccalaureate in data analysis, management and visualization techniques and also writing analysis reports, abstracts for conferences and manuscripts. While doing so, I developed much interest in the concept of “Reproducible Research”. I learnt and strengthened my analytical skills specifically in “R” platform to generate reproducible analyses. This motivated me to be an advocate for Open Science and Reproducible Research.\n\n\n\nI also reflected on my NIH journey in this atomic essay."

In our future endeavors, we aim to develop and test targeted strategies to mitigate these stress-induced health impacts, potentially transforming workplace wellness programs and policies to better support our healthcare workers’ well-being.\n\nEffectiveness of mindfulness in reducing perceived stress among Nurses: A systematic review and meta- analysis.\n\nRole: PI\nFunding: None\nOur investigation into the impacts of occupational stress on sleep quality and inflammation in nurses laid the foundation for an important subsequent step. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, during which I had the privilege of mentoring an MPH dissertation student.\nWe registered our protocol in PROSPERO (Access record here), demonstrating our commitment to transparency and rigor. Over the course of the project, we thoroughly examined the existing literature, assessing the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions among nurses. This work was particularly groundbreaking in the Indian context, where mindfulness practices remain less prevalent within healthcare settings.\nThis study shed light on how mindfulness can help ease the stress nurses face, offering practical ways to create workplaces where they can truly thrive, not just get by. It was a fulfilling effort that adds meaningful insights to support the well-being of the people who are the backbone of healthcare."
