## 2003-2010

### Stanley Medical College \| Chennai, India \| MBBS

I graduated my Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 2010. While preparing for my MD entrance exams, I decided not to follow the herd and thus I embarked on my research journey.

## 2012-2017

### NIMHANS \| Bangalore, India \| PhD in Clinical Neurosciences

As a PhD student (ICMR MD-PHD fellowship) under the supervision of Dr. Pratima Murthy M.D (Psychiatry), at National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, I worked in the capacity of a Junior Resident (for three years) and a Senior Resident (for two years) in the Department of Clinical Neurosciences. I was associated with the Centre for Addiction Medicine, NIMHANS which is the Regional Centre for South India. I specialized in Substance Use Disorders with a special focus in Alcohol Use Disorder. I also got trained in Genetics and Epigenetics of Alcohol Use Disorder in the Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the Neurobiology Research Centre, NIMHANS. I aimed at examining epigenetic changes in alcohol and one carbon metabolism genes in the context of nutritional changes and treatment outcome in a prospective cohort study. By adopting a longitudinal approach, I investigated the potential methylation changes in the regions of interest.

## 2018-2020

### NIAAA/NIH \| PostDoc \| 2018 - 2020

This was a particularly notable and enriching experience of my life. As a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) / National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA from 2018-2020, I worked in the capacity of an Assistant Investigator in the protocols of my section at Human Psychopharmacology, NIAAA/NIH under the supervision of Dr. Vijay Ramchandani, Ph.D. At the lab, we conducted research on human subjects administering intravenous alcohol infusions along with post-baccalaureate candidates in my section. I was involved in writing and conducting protocols, grants, authored manuscripts in a collaborative environment. At the NIH, I was trained at multiple domains, including Responsible Conduct of Research, online technology transfer, data quality management, writing research papers, On becoming a responsible researcher, and also on workplace management. I worked on multiple data projects, maintaining data in a safe and secured manner, involved in developing analysis pipelines for quantitative data analyses. I also mentored post-baccalaureate in data analysis, management and visualization techniques and also writing analysis reports, abstracts for conferences and manuscripts. While doing so, I developed much interest in the concept of "Reproducible Research". I learnt and strengthened my analytical skills specifically in "R" platform to generate reproducible analyses. This motivated me to be an advocate for Open Science and Reproducible Research.

## 2020-2021

I returned from the USA in the midst of the pandemic. This was a difficult time professionally. Yet, I made the best use of my time by diving into RoamResearch and set of courses that strengthened my grantsmanship, writing and analytical skills.

## 2021 - February 2025

### ICMR-NIOH \| Medical Scientist - B

At ICMR-NIOH, I focused on occupational health, particularly occupational mental health, in alignment with the institute’s mission. My work spanned stress research, biomarker development, and reproducible analytics pipelines.

## March 2025 - Present

### ICMR-NIOH-ROHC(S) \| Medical Scientist - C

I was promoted to Scientist C under the *exceptionally meritorious category* in January 2025 and transferred to ICMR-Regional Occupational Health Centre (South), Bangalore, in March 2025. I continue to work in occupational health, with updated priorities:

1.  Occupational stress interventions and biomarkers

2.  Climate change and health systems – secondary data analyses

#### My lifetime vision

-   To administer effective workplace interventions to combat occupational stress associated and driven substance use disorders.

-   To be an advocate of Open Science.

#### Ten year goals

-   To develop a comprehensive toolkit for assessing occupational mental health in the Indian context.

-   To understand how occupational stress and associated factors contribute to substance use vulnerability and continuation.

-   To test and develop various workplace interventions to combat occupational stress and substance use problems.

-   Develop human resources and spark interest in responsible and reproducible research
